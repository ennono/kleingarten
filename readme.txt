Kleingarten turns your website into a valuable digital gardening tool.

== Description ==

Maintaining an allotment garden association is becoming more and more complex. At the same time, associations lack streamlined processes and modern resources.

As a committed allotment gardener, you sacrifice a lot of free time for the association. Your commitment requires a great deal of expertise, is too seldom appreciated and little thanked.

What if you could enjoy your free time in your garden instead of sacrificing it to the association's bureaucracy?

With Kleingarten, you can turn your WordPress website into a valuable digital gardening tool.
